# Spine add-on for Construct 3

Add-on based on **Mikal's** sample from this thread: 

[https://www.construct.net/en/forum/construct-3/general-discussion-7/spine-animation-js-template-145940 ](https://www.construct.net/en/forum/construct-3/general-discussion-7/spine-animation-js-template-145940) 

For now it uses **additional canvases** for each spine skeleton, which are used as textures in C3 rendering process. I found this method not really fast on mobile browsers. But I haven't succeed in direct drawing into c3 WebGL context yet.
